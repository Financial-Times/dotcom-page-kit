# Migrating from n-ui to Page Kit (v0.1.0)

üèó WIP üèó

##  Remove n-ui

_NOTE: This is quite a long step and you may need a notepad and pen._

- Update `.gitignore`, replace all the `public/*` lines with a single `public/` line.
- Remove n-ui scripts from `makefile`, we will add replacement scripts later.
- Remove n-ui as a dependency from `bower.json` and `package.json` (but leave n-ui-foundations, Page Kit does not replace any part of n-ui-foundations).
- Delete `n-ui-build.config.js` in the app root directory.

### Client-side

#### Sass

- Open the Sass entry point and remove `@import 'n-ui/main';`.
- Remove any `nUiStylesheetStart/nUiStylesheetEnd` mixins from the Sass source code, there is no equivalent in Page Kit.

#### JavaScript

- Open the client-side JS entry point.
- Remove any dependency on `n-ui` or `@financial-times/n-ui`.
- Comment out any references to `flags` imported from n-ui, we will bring them back later.
- Delete any references to `allstylesloaded` and hoist the contents of its callback into the parent scope.
- Delete any `onAppInitialised()` calls.

### Server-side

- Install n-express:
  ```bash
  npm install -S @financial-times/n-express
  ```
- Open the application entry point (usually `server/app.js`) and replace the dependency on n-ui:
  ```diff
  - const express = require('@financial-times/n-ui');
  + const express = require('@financial-times/n-express');
  ```

- Update the Express server initialisation options, at a minimum set `withFlags`, `withConsent` and `withAnonMiddleware` to `true`.
  ```diff
  const app = express({
    ...
  + withFlags: true,
  + withConsent: true,
  + withAnonMiddleware: true
  });
  ```
- If any `helpers` are being registered at this time comment out these dependencies and then remove the `helpers` option.
- Make a note of what features `app.locals.nUiConfig = {}` is configuring and then delete it.
    - See https://github.com/Financial-Times/n-ui/blob/master/browser/js/app-initializer.js for the complete list of features.
    - _Please note_ that we will need to initialise any client-side components not included in Page Kit later, such as image lazy loading, n-feedback, o-date, etc.

- Finally, search for any references to `n-ui` and `nui` and clean up what's left. Commit your work and have a cup of tea, you've earned it!


##  Implement Page Kit Handlebars as Express view engine

_NOTE: This is probably the hardest step and this will vary between applications depending on how it extends or works around the limitations of Handlebars._

- Install the Handlebars package:
  ```bash
  npm install -S @financial-times/dotcom-server-handlebars
  ```
- Register Handlebars as an Express view engine and configure the helper functions:
    ```js
    const { PageKitHandlebars, helpers } = require('@financial-times/dotcom-server-handlebars');
    app.engine('.html', new PageKitHandlebars({ helpers }).engine);
    ```
    If your app was using any additional Handlebars helpers configure them now.

- Update all `response.render()` calls in the application's controllers to include the `.html` file extension.
- If your application is using Handlebars directly (`require('handlebars')`):
    - Don't! Handlebars is a singleton...
    - ...and n-ui implemented a hack to load partial templates on application startup and append them to this.
    - If necessary refactor the application to use a shared instance of `PageKitHandlebars`, you may prefer to add a new `handlebars-setup.js` module to achieve this.
- Run the application (`make run`) and load it in your browser:
    - This is the point in the migration where you will find out if your application is using any unsupported Handlebars helpers. For instance, Page Kit does not support `{{#defineBlock}}{{/defineBlock}}` as it uses a different mechanism for inserting content into the document `<head>` and before/after the header and footer slots. Handlebars supports an inline partials mechanism which you can use instead if necessary.
    - Comment out the use of any other unsupported helpers for now and make a note of them.

  It's important to get the application running and verify that it is delivering the expected HTML at this point as we will verify each of the following stages by running the application and checking it in the browser.
- Commit your work.


## Setup basic build task for client-side JS and Sass

_NOTE: This is probably the second hardest step and may vary between applications and the dependencies it uses._

- Install the Page Kit build packages:
    ```bash
    npm install -D \
        @financial-times/dotcom-page-kit-cli \
        @financial-times/dotcom-build-js \
        @financial-times/dotcom-build-sass \
        @financial-times/dotcom-build-bower-resolve
    ```
- Create a `page-kit.config.js` file in the repository root:
    ```js
    module.exports = {
        plugins: [
            require('@financial-times/dotcom-build-js').plugin(),
            require('@financial-times/dotcom-build-sass').plugin(),
            require('@financial-times/dotcom-build-bower-resolve').plugin()
        ],
        settings: {
            build: {
                entry: {
                    scripts: './client/main.js',
                    styles: './client/main.scss'
                },
                outputPath: path.resolve('./public')
            }
        }
    };
    ```
- Configure Page Kit build steps in the application's `makefile`:
    ```diff
    build:
    +	page-kit build --development
    build-production:
    +	page-kit build
    watch:
    +	page-kit build --development --watch
    ```
- Build the application and check the output in the browser:
    - There may be a number of warnings output to the console, inspect these but they can usually be ignored.
    - If there are any errors resolve these now. In our tests the most common cause of problems is CJS/ESM interoperability.
    - Open the `public/` folder and ensure the expected JS and CSS files are being generated along with a `manifest.json` file.

  It's important to get the application building correctly without any errors at this stage. If you are unsure run `make build-production` which will fail if any problems are found.
- Commit your work.


## Setup basic integration with the Page Kit shell

- Install the shell package:
   ```bash
   npm install -S @financial-times/dotcom-ui-shell
   ```
- Install react, react-dom and the eslint react plugin (this is required by n-gage):
   ```bash
   npm install -S \
     react \
     react-dom \
     eslint-plugin-react
   ```
- Create a `page-kit-shell.js` file in the application's `/server` directory with the following content:
   ```js
   const React = require('react');
   const ReactDOM = require('react-dom/server');
   const { Shell } = require('@financial-times/dotcom-ui-shell');

   module.exports = ({ response, next, shellProps }) => {
     return (error, html) => {
       if (error) {
         return next(error);
       }

       const document = React.createElement(
         Shell,
         { ...shellProps, contents: html }
       );

       response.send('<!DOCTYPE html>' + ReactDOM.renderToStaticMarkup(document));
     };
   };
   ```
- Integrate the new `page-kit-shell.js` module in the application's controller files.
    - Require the module.
    - Create a `shellProps` object.
    - Create a `pageKitArgs` object passing in Express route handler params and `shellProps`.
    - Pass the shell with its arguments as a third parameter to the `render()` call.
    ```js
    const pageKitShell = require('./[PATH]/page-kit-shell');
    ...
    const shellProps = {
      pageTitle: 'application-title'
    };
    const pageKitArgs = { request, response, next, shellProps };
    ...
    res.render('layout.html', templateData, pageKitShell(pageKitArgs));
    ```
- Build and run the application and check the output in the browser.
   - Bootstrap scripts and meta tags should be present in the rendered HTML.
   - The page should have a pink background.
- Commit your work.


## Implement the layout component with navigation data

- Install the layout component and the navigation middleware:
   ```bash
     npm install -S \
       @financial-times/dotcom-ui-layout \
       @financial-times/dotcom-middleware-navigation
   ```
- Require the navigation middleware in your application's server file and add it to the list of middlewares being used by your application.
  ```diff
  app.use(
  + navigationMiddleware.init()
    ...
  );
  ```
- Integrate the layout component with your application controllers.
   - Create a `layoutProps` object.
   - Add `layoutProps` to the existing `pageKitArgs`.
     ```js
     const layoutProps = {
       navigationData: response.locals.navigation,
       headerOptions: { ...response.locals.anon }
     };
     ...
     const pageKitArgs = { request, response, next, shellProps, layoutProps };
     ```
- Integrate the layout component with your `page-kit-shell.js` module.
   - Require the module.
   - Add `layoutProps` to the function arguments.
   - Pass `layoutProps` to the existing `document` component.
     ```diff
     + const { Layout } = require('@financial-times/dotcom-ui-layout');
       ...
     - module.exports = ({ response, next, shellProps }) => {
     + module.exports = ({ response, next, shellProps, layoutProps }) => {
       ...
       const document = React.createElement(
         Shell,
     -   { ...shellProps, contents: html }
     +   { ...shellProps },
     +   React.createElement(Layout, { ...layoutProps, contents: html })
       );
     ```
- ‚ÄãBuild and run the application and check the output in the browser.
   - The header, footer and navigation elements should be present in the rendered html.
- Commit your work.


## Setup Bower package resolution for Page Kit components

- Install the bower glob resolver package as a devDependency:
   ```bash
    npm install -D bower-glob-resolve
   ```
- Add the new resolver to the application's `.bowerrc`:
   ```json
    { "resolvers": ["bower-glob-resolver"] }
   ```
- Use the resolver to add the Page Kit UI components as bower dependencies in the `bower.json` file:
  ```json
  "dependencies": {
    "page-kit-ui-components": "glob:node_modules/@financial-times/dotcom-ui-*/bower.json"
  }
  ```
- Initialise the layout component in the application's client-side JS entrypoint:
   ```js
    import * as layout from '@financial-times/dotcom-ui-layout'
    ...
    layout.init()
   ```
- Import the UI styles in the application's client-side styles entrypoint:
   ```scss
    @import '@financial-times/dotcom-ui-layout/styles';
    @import '@financial-times/dotcom-ui-header/styles';
    @import '@financial-times/dotcom-ui-footer/styles';
   ```
- Delete and reinstall the `bower_components` directory.
- ‚ÄãBuild and run the application and check the output in the browser.
  - The header and footer elements should be styled.
- Commit your work.


## Add the asset loader and provide styles and scripts to the shell

- Install the assets middleware:
    ```
    npm install -S @financial-times/dotcom-middleware-assets
    ```
- Integrate the assets middleware in the application's server file.
  - Require the module.
  - Add an `isProduction` boolean statement.
  - Add the middleware to the list of middlewares being used by your application and configure the `hostStaticAssets` and `publicPath` options.
    ```diff
    + const assetsMiddleware = require('@financial-times/dotcom-middleware-assets');
    ...
    + const isProduction = process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production';
    ...
    app.use(
    +  assetsMiddleware.init({
    +    hostStaticAssets: !isProduction,
    +    publicPath: isProduction ? '/__assets/hashed/page-kit' : '/__dev/assets/[application-name]'
    +  })
    );
    ```
- Use the assets loader api to add `enhancedScripts` and `stylesheets` properties to the existing `shellProps`‚Äã object:
    ```diff
    const shellProps = {
    + enhancedScripts: response.locals.assets.loader.getScriptURLsFor(entrypoint),
    + stylesheets: response.locals.assets.loader.getStylesheetURLsFor(entrypoint
    ...
    }
    ```
- Bump dependencies to support loading assets with Page Kit.
    - Bump n-gage to `v3.9.2` or higher.
    - Bump n-heroku-tools to `v8.3.0` or higher.
- ‚ÄãBuild and run the application and check the output in the browser.
  - The network tab should show the expected requests for script files and stylesheets.
- Commit your work.
