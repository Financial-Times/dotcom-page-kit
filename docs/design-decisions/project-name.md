# Design Decisions: Project Name

The FT.com Page Kit project was started by the "Core UI" team at the end of 2018. This name was used internally to pitch the project but we decided early on that the tools we built should not use this name because mentioning "UI" is confusing to anybody unfamiliar with the project and the assumption is made that we may be changing design or interface elements.

To avoid the project being confused with any UI changes we originally branded the tools we were making "Anvil" because it's a neat metaphor - a solid base upon which another object is struck. However, whilst this name avoided confusion about affecting any UI it was ambiguous and required explaining constantly.

To resolve this we decided to choose a name which was short but descriptive. We wanted a name which had implied boundaries and could be used to decide what features should and should not be included within it.

Eventually we settled on "Page Kit" because the tools we've built are specifically designed to deliver _web pages_. The name does not imply that we're associated with UX&D nor that all tools for building web services should be placed under its banner.
