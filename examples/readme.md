# Anvil examples

These examples are to help you learn about Anvil's core concepts, see how the pieces fit together and get you acquainted with some of the more useful packages.

There are a few bigger examples that show more complete setups (or flavours) of app.

One day, we hope to use them as part of our end to end tests.

## Creating examples, your help required

It would help others to learn about Anvil if you add an example. If you have an idea for a helpful example, open an issue to discuss it. 

Here's what you should be aiming for:

1. A very short readme that explains the point of the example and notes the most intesting things to look for
2. Demonstrate only one or two ideas
3. the code should contain only essentials so the reader can easily see what you're demonstrating
4. comment your code
5. consider adding a example as part of a PR for a new feature
