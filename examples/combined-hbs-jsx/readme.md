# Example of combined Handlebars (HBS) and JSX

This package demonstrates the ability to either:
- pass Handlebars output to JSX components
- pass JSX output to Handlebars partials
and for it to be rendered within the context of the receiving component/partial.


### Running the app

```
npm start
```

Then visit these URLs in your browser:

- `localhost:3456/hbs-to-jsx` (to view Handlebars output passed to a JSX component)
- `localhost:3456/jsx-to-hbs` (to view JSX output passed to a Handlebars partial)


### Running the tests

```
npm test
```
