# Example Rendering with dotcom-ui-shell

This package demonstrates the use of anvil to create a react app that renders pages on the server while also hydrating them on the client. Some notable things that it features are as follows:

- The use of `dotcom-ui-shell` `initialProps` functionality
- Dynamic imports
- Custom plugins

### Running the app

First run the following command to build the client side assets

```
npm run build
```

Then run the following command to start the app

```
npm run start
```

Then open `localhost:3000` in your browser
