# Building Sass Files Example

This example demonstrates how to compile Sass source code using the [CLI] and the [Sass plugin]. It also shows some of the useful optimisations provided by PostCSS.

Source files are stored in the `src/` directory and the output will be stored in a directory named `dist/`. To run the build script run `npm run build`.

[CLI]: ../../packages/anvil-cli/readme.md
[Sass plugin]: ../../packages/dotcom-build-sass/readme.md
