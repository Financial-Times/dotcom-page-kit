# Building Sass Files Example

This example demonstrates how to compile Sass source code using the [Anvil CLI] and the [Anvil Sass plugin]. It also shows some of the useful optimisations provided by PostCSS.

Source files are stored in the `src/` directory and the output will be stored in a directory named `dist/`. To run the build script run `npm run build`.
