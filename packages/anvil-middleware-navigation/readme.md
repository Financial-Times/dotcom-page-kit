# Navigation Middleware

The Navigation middleware provides navigation methods to templates. It does this by appending a new instance of the navigation package to app.locals on app startup.

The navigation data must be present in order to render the navigation components for the page.

Stream pages include a crumbtrail component.

This middleware should be consumed by your application's server file.
