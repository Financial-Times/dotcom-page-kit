# Normalize

This is a small CSS module to mitigate over-opinionated UA styles. Although we are generally against global styles we must balance this with the need to keep our code DRY.

The snippets have been taken from [normalize.css](https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css) on the basis that they are either the rules we most commonly repeat or forget which may lead to cross-browser inconsistencies.

## Usage

### Sass

This module is bundled by default and cannot be configured.
