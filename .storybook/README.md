# About the Storybook Setup

The main thing to know about the setup is that the `config.js` file is generated from the template located at `./config.template.js`, using the script located at `./scripts/generateConfig.js`. We have to generate the config file because it is currently the only performant way of having the stories be discovered automatically. Because the `config.js` file is prebuilt with webpack using a webpack config that targets the browser, it is not possible to use node modules like `fs` in it, which means that we cannot access the filesystem from it. We tried using the [require.context](textNotifyingOfGeneration()) webpack feature and it worked, but was too slow to be usable. The only option left is to automatically generate the config file before starting up storybook.
