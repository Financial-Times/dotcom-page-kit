# Anvil Roadmap

## Summer 2019

### v0.0.1

- Initial publication of Anvil packages in order to support development of the first applications to be migrated from n-ui to Anvil.

### v0.1.0

  - _Please note_ that the initial app integrations have been designed to "show our working" and will not include any extra abstraction or sugar.

### v0.2.0

- This release will include a range of small refactors to:
  - Smooth any rough edges and irritations found during the initial app releases.
  - Address the minor issues we logged during development but deprioritised.

### v0.3.0

- An initial release of some "preset" packages which wrap together the repeated patterns found whilst performing the n-ui to Anvil migrations so far.

### v0.4.0

- n-ui to Anvil migration guide complete.
- Make the repository public.
